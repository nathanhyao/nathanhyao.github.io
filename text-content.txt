Hi! My name is Nathan Yao. I am a junior undergraduate student in Computer Science at Purdue University. I enjoy it because creativity and analysis is necessary to form something beautiful here, like in other fields of art. Please scroll down to see some of my programming projects and paintings.

Here are some recent programming projects that I am proud of. Projects are created in academia and in my free time. To see more please visit my GitHub.

An algorithm that determines enzyme performance given experiment data. Mathematically models the data using quadratic regression and calculus in MATLAB. Generates graphs and tables.

ART

Aside from computer science, I also like to draw and take pictures. Below are some of my recent digital paintings. Please check out my Instagram for photographs. I will create and upload new artwork in the future.
